                        <p><strong>_Ferrari</strong> S.p.A. (/fəˈrɑːri/, Italian: [ferˈraːri]) is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in 
                        Maranello. Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari (1898–1988), the company built its first car in 1940, adopted its current name 
                        in 1945, and began to produce its current line of road cars in 1947. 
                        Ferrari became a public company in 1960, and from 1963 to 2014 it was a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. It was spun off from 
                        Fiat's successor entity, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles,in 2016. The company currently offers a large model range which                            includes several supercars, grand tourers, and one SUV. Many early Ferraris, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, count among 
                        the most expensive cars ever sold at auction.

                        Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One, 
                        where its team, Scuderia Ferrari, is the series' single oldest and most successful. Scuderia Ferrari has raced since 1929, first in 
                        Grand Prix events and later in Formula One, where since 1952 it has fielded fifteen champion drivers, won sixteen 
                        Constructors' Championships, and accumulated more race victories, 1–2 finishes, podiums, pole positions, fastest laps                               and points than any other team in F1 history. Historically, Ferrari was also highly active in sports car racing, where 
                        its cars took many wins in races such as the Mille Miglia, Targa Florio and 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as several 
                        overall victories in the World Sportscar Championship. Scuderia Ferrari fans, commonly called tifosi, are known for their 
                        passion and loyalty to the team.

                        Ferrari is one of the world's strongest brands, and it maintains a brand image built around racing heritage, luxury, and 
                        exclusivity. As of May 2023, Ferrari is also one of the largest car manufacturers by market capitalisation, with a value 
                        of approximately US$85.5 billion.
